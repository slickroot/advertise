## Description
Advertise is an adverstising agnecy backend system, it exposes an API that helps track what's going on with active ads.
The system can be notified of certain events, and it updates a database accordingly, it can also give you a bunch of reports.

## Run
`docker compose up` should be enough to get the system up and running.

## E2E Tests
There's an E2E test suite that helped me write the API, you can run it on docker compose.
`docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.e2e.yml up`
